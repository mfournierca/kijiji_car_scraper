Get used car information and analyze it.

Notes

- ask for maintenance history
- get a used car that had female as primary / sole driver
- price will be $400 / month no matter what
- get insurance bundled with bank / house insurance
- we should be able to get something in the 2 - 3 years old, 15 - 20k range
- at 2% over 3 years, with 5k down, this translates as $282 -> $430 / month
- there is an official goverment data base of used car values, used for taxes
